# Yocto Project Exploration Guide for QEMU & Raspberry Pi 4 with Qt GUI

Welcome to this GitHub repository, where I'm documenting my journey learning the Yocto Project. This guide is meant to help myself and others understand how to use Yocto to create custom Linux-based systems for embedded products, focusing on both QEMU virtualization and the Raspberry Pi 4 hardware.

### What We'll Explore:

* **Introduction to Yocto** : Starting with the basics of what the Yocto Project is and why it's useful for embedded development.
* **Kickstart with Yocto** : How to set up your first Yocto build for QEMU and Raspberry Pi 4.
* **Creating a Simple Layer** : My first steps in creating a Yocto layer and how it can be used to customize your build.
* **Understanding Variables** : Learning about key Yocto variables that affect the build process.
* **Recipes and Tasks** : Attempting to write recipes and define tasks with some simple examples to try out.
* **Recipe Patch Task** : Exploring how to patch recipes to modify or improve existing functionalities.
* **SystemD Integration** : Learning how to manage services with SystemD in a Yocto build.
* **Building an SDK** : Developing a Software Development Kit using Yocto to simplify the workflow for other developers.
* **Qt Cross-Compilation for Raspberry Pi 4** : Navigating through the process of cross-compiling Qt applications for the Raspberry Pi using Yocto, aimed at GUI development.

### Who Should Join This Journey?

This repository is ideal for anyone who is new to embedded systems, curious about the Yocto Project, or interested in building and learning alongside me. Whether you're a student, hobbyist, or early-career developer, you're welcome to explore and contribute.

### Getting Started:

We'll go through each section together, learning and documenting the steps as we progress.

### Contributing:

Since I'm still learning, I welcome suggestions, corrections, and contributions from anyone! Feel free to submit pull requests or discuss ideas through issues. This is a space for shared learning and growth.

### Need Help or Want to Discuss?

If you encounter any problems or want to suggest something new, please open an issue on this GitHub page. Let's support each other in this learning journey!
